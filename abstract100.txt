Performance and optimization of X-ray grating interferometry
=================================================================

A teoretical description of the performance of a Talbot and Talbot-Lau
type interferometers is developed, providing a framework for the
optimization of the geometry for both a monochromatic and a polychromatic
source. Analytical formulas for the smallest
detectable refraction angle and the visibility of the setup are derived.
